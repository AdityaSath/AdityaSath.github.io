              <li>My JobScraper is a web scraper that scrapes job boards for open positions to apply for by parsing the site's HTML file for keywords/phrases</li>
              <li>The script interacts with the site by clicking embedded links like "next" or "load more" to fetch more results, handling pagination</li>
              <li>It then compiles all results and spits out clickable links for me to follow</li>
              <li>Written in <u>Python</u> inside VSCode Jupyter Notebook. Automation is done using the <u>Selenium Framework</u> where <u>Selenium WebDriver</u> opens the page and handles all site interaction</li>
              <li>I used the <u>BeautifulSoup framework</u> for all HTML parsing and pattern recogniztion within the href attributes. It also handles all simulated action tasks</li>
